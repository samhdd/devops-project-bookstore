# Testing Framework Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement comprehensive testing for both backend and frontend to ensure code quality, prevent regressions, and support continuous integration.

## Tasks

### 1. Backend Testing

- [ ] **Set up testing environment**
  - Install pytest and related packages
  - Configure test database connection
  - Set up fixtures and test helpers

- [ ] **Unit Tests**
  - Database models and queries
  - API route handlers
  - Authentication logic
  - Business logic functions
  - Utility functions

- [ ] **Integration Tests**
  - API endpoint behavior
  - Database interactions
  - External service interactions

- [ ] **Configuration**
  - Create pytest.ini
  - Configure test coverage reporting
  - Set up CI-compatible test runners

### 2. Frontend Testing

- [ ] **Set up testing tools**
  - Configure Jest for unit testing
  - Set up React Testing Library
  - Configure Cypress for E2E testing

- [ ] **Component Tests**
  - UI component rendering
  - State management
  - Event handling
  - Form validation

- [ ] **Integration Tests**
  - Page behavior
  - API interactions
  - Authentication flows
  - Navigation and routing

- [ ] **End-to-End Tests**
  - Critical user journeys
  - Shopping cart flow
  - Checkout process
  - Account management

### 3. Test Data Management

- [ ] Create test fixtures and factories
- [ ] Set up mock API responses
- [ ] Create seed data for test database
- [ ] Implement data cleanup between tests

### 4. CI Integration

- [ ] Configure test runs in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Set up test reporting
- [ ] Configure test coverage thresholds
- [ ] Add status badges to README

### 5. Performance Testing

- [ ] Set up load testing tools (k6, Artillery)
- [ ] Create performance test scenarios
- [ ] Establish performance baselines
- [ ] Configure alerting for performance regressions

### 6. Documentation

- [ ] Document testing approach
- [ ] Create contributing guidelines for tests
- [ ] Add test examples and patterns

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (1-2 weeks)
- Set up basic testing infrastructure
- Write tests for critical components
- Establish CI integration

### Phase 2: Coverage Expansion (1-2 weeks)
- Increase test coverage across components
- Implement E2E testing
- Create comprehensive test data

### Phase 3: Advanced Testing (1 week)
- Performance testing
- Security testing
- Edge case handling

## Benefits
- Early bug detection
- Code quality improvement
- Documentation through tests
- Safer refactoring
- Support for CI/CD pipeline
